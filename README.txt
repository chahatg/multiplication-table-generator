This is the code to create multiplication table generator with form validation

For validation, I used input type as numbers so i had the standard check provided by html so I didnt have validate using the jquery plugin that the input is a number.

I used the jquery plugin to add a range restriction to make sure all numbers entered are between -75 and 75. 
I also had a "required field" check.

In conclusion, in my rules I had these checks
Input: Ensuring that there is input at all
Number: if any character be it alpha or special char, it will be invalid.
Min.:-75
Max.:75
